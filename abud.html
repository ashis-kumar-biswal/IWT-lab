Historical Significance
Historically, Mount Abu has been a significant site for both Jain and Hindu religions. It is believed to be the retreat of Sage Vashistha, who performed a yajna (sacrificial ritual) here, seeking divine intervention for righteousness on earth. The name "Abu" is derived from the ancient name "Arbuda," linked to a legend involving a serpent that saved the life of Nandi, Lord Shiva's bull. The region is also home to several ancient temples, including the famous Dilwara Jain Temples, known for their intricate marble carvings, which attract pilgrims and tourists alike.
